Paul was opposed by certain Jewish Christians who argued that circumcision was necessary for non-Jewish Christians</p><h2>Author</h2><p>Paul</p><h2>Date</h2><p>Likely AD 48 or 49, just prior to the Jerusalem council</p><h2>Setting</h2><p>Written after a group of Jewish Christians had infiltrated the Galatian church communities, teaching on the necessity of practicing circumcision (the removal of the foreskin of the male reproductive organ, which was a sign of Israel&apos;s special relationship with God)</p>",
