    "content": "<p>The Book of Acts</p><h2>Purpose</h2><p>To describe the spread of the good news of Jesus Christ and the formation of the church from Jerusalem throughout the Roman world</p><h2>Author</h2><p>Luke, a physician and occasional companion of the apostle Paul</p><h2>Date</h2><p>Likely between the early 60s AD and the mid-80s AD. The events recorded in Acts end in the early 60s, but a commonly held view suggests that it was written later, presuming that Luke’s Gospel used the Gospel of Mark as a source. The Gospel of Mark was likely written in the late 60s</p><h2>Setting</h2><p>Written during a time when the good news of Jesus had spread throughout the Mediterranean world and it had become evident that God’s salvation extended to both Jews and gentiles (non-Jewish people)</p>",
