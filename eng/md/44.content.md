## Acts (id: 27401)

The Book of Acts

Purpose
-------

To describe the spread of the good news of Jesus Christ and the formation of the church from Jerusalem throughout the Roman world

Author
------

Luke, a physician and occasional companion of the apostle Paul

Date
----

Likely between the early 60s AD and the mid\-80s AD. The events recorded in Acts end in the early 60s, but a commonly held view suggests that it was written later, presuming that Luke’s Gospel used the Gospel of Mark as a source. The Gospel of Mark was likely written in the late 60s

Setting
-------

Written during a time when the good news of Jesus had spread throughout the Mediterranean world and it had become evident that God’s salvation extended to both Jews and gentiles (non\-Jewish people)

* **Associated Passages:** ACT 1:1
